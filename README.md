# Kaggle-Competition-Planet
Here are three files I have used during Kaggle Competition Planet. These three files have been used to tune VGG19  to predict labels in Planet dataset. I competed solo and scored top 20% in this competition (out of 938 teams). Here's the link for the private leaderboard; you can download the dataset from there too.
