# Kaggle-Competition-Planet
Here are three files I have used during Kaggle Competition Planet. These three files have been used to tune VGG19 at 3 steps in order to predict labels in Planet dataset. I scored top 20% in this competition. Here's the link for the private leaderboard, you can download the dataset from there too.
